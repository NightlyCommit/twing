/**
 * Exception thrown when an error occurs during template loading.
 *
 * Automatic template information guessing is always turned off as
 * if a template cannot be loaded, there is nothing to guess.
 * However, when a template is loaded from another one, then, we need
 * to find the current context and this is automatically done by
 * TwingTemplate::displayWithErrorHandling().
 *
 * This strategy makes TwingEnvironment::resolveTemplate() much faster.
