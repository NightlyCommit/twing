First-class Twig engine for Node.js

## Philosophy behind Twing

We believe that a first-class Twig engine should be able to render any template to the exact same result as the official PHP engine. That means that it should implement 100% of the syntax defined by the language specifications and that it should render that syntax using PHP logic.

We also believe that a first-class Twig engine should be able to catch-up easily when Twig specifications evolve. Its code architecture and philosophy should then be as close as possible as the PHP implementation.

Finally, we believe that a first-class Twig engine should allow users to build on their experience with TwigPHP and get support from the huge community that comes with it.

That's what Twing is. A maintainability-first engine that pass 100% of the TwigPHP integration tests, is as close as possible to its code structure and expose an as-close-as-possible API.

## Prerequisites

Twing needs at least **node.js 6.0.0** to run but it is highly recommended to use **node.js 8.x** to enjoy the best performance possible.

## Installation

The recommended way to install Twing is via npm:

`npm install twing --save`

## Basic API Usage

```js
const Twing = require('twing');

let loader = new Twing.TwingLoaderArray({
    'index.twig': 'Hello {{ name }}!'
});
let twing = new Twing.TwingEnvironment(loader);

let output = twing.render('index.twig', {name: 'Fabien'});
```

## About async support

Unfortunately, async support had to be removed starting from 0.10.0, for two reasons:

* Unpredictable behavior when used with Promise because of the output buffering mechanism not being ready for async operations. Twing rendering was reliable only when called using `await` and thus only when used synchronously. There was no point at keeping async support if the engine is only able to return predictable results when used synchronously.
* Sub-par performance because of the huge overhead introduced by the async/await syntax.

Async support will be re-added post-1.0 and as an option. Since performance issues are likely to persist in the future (the overhead is inherent to the use of Promise under the hood), users who only need sync support should not be impacted by the performance cost of async support. In the mean time, when async support will be re-introduced, usage of Promise will be possible and that should compensate for the overhead for those that need async support.
