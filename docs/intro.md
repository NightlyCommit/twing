First-class Twig engine for Node.js

## Philosophy behind Twing

We believe that a first-class Twig engine should be able to render any template to the exact same result as the official PHP engine. That means that it should implement 100% of the syntax defined by the language specifications and that it should render that syntax using PHP logic.

We also believe that a first-class Twig engine should be able to catch-up easily when Twig specifications evolve. Its code architecture and philosophy should then be as close as possible as the PHP implementation.

Finally, we believe that a first-class Twig engine should allow users to build on their experience with TwigPHP and get support from the huge community that comes with it.

That's what Twing is. A maintainability-first engine that pass 100% of the TwigPHP integration tests, is as close as possible to its code structure and expose an as-close-as-possible API.

## Prerequisites

Twing needs at least **node.js 7.6.0** to run.

## Installation

The recommended way to install Twing is via npm:

`npm i twing --save`

## Basic API Usage

This section gives you a brief introduction to the node.js API for Twing.

```js
const Twing = require('twing');

let loader = new Twing.TwingLoaderArray({
    'index.twig': 'Hello {{ name }}!'
});
let twing = new Twing.TwingEnvironment(loader);

let output = await twing.render('index.twig', {name: 'Fabien'});
```

Twing uses a loader (`TwingLoaderArray`) to locate templates, and an
environment (`TwingEnvironment`) to store the configuration.

The `render()` method loads the template passed as a first argument and
renders it with the variables passed as a second argument.

As templates are generally stored on the filesystem, Twing also comes with a
filesystem loader:

```js
const Twing = require('twing');

let loader = new Twing.TwingLoaderFilesystem('/path/to/templates');
let twing = new Twing.TwingEnvironment(loader);

let ouput = await twing.render('index.html', {'name': 'Fabien'});
```

## Asynchronous by nature

Starting with 0.4.0, Twing is asynchronous by nature. It means that `TwingEnvironment::render`,`TwingEnvironment::display` and the belonging `TwingTemplate` functions return a Promise. This asynchronous nature makes possible to implement asynchronous filters, functions and tests.

```js
class SleepExtenstion extends Twing.TwingExtension {
    getFunctions() {
        return [
            new Twing.TwingFunction('sleep', function(duration) {
                return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, duration));      
            })
        ];
    }
}
```
